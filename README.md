Adopt-a-pet complete!

My pick 2 were the following:

1) complete the Form class:
add a Form with 3 fields to the Form class (applicantName, address, phone number)
add a fillForm method to the Form class
add a printForm method to the Main driver class

2) save the appointment to a file (read/write)

Extras) I wanted to have a complete app so I did everything! :)

Be able to call up/print the appointment
stats (list the number of pets in the shelter, etc... along with the number of dogs, cats, etc...)
filter the pets by type (dog, cat, etc...)
